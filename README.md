# Steeme
Steemit posting analysis tool

I am introducing SteemMe project. SteemMe is my personal project that aims to help the Steemians to discover the hidden information about themselves. This tool helps those who want:
- to see all of their postings with the vote count, resteem count and number of comments
- to download their entire postings as a JSON file
- to filter out their postings with keywords
- to check the SBD of the each vote on their posting
- to find out who have resteemed their posting
- to analyse the trend of vote, comment, reward of their postings
- to know top 25 frequent voters
- to know top 25 strong voters
- to know top 15 frequent resteemers
- to know top 10 most resteemed postings

I hope people to enjoy analysing and understanding their posting history, and also clearly figure out who have been kindly supporting them. The latest version is 0.3, and I have some cool ideas to broaden the functionality of the tool. However I am struggling to put my hands on this project due to my work got much busier. Anyone can contribute to this project. Pull request is more than welcome.
